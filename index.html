      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m Hendrico Stapelberg, and I’m excited to share my journey into
        the world of web design and development. After spending years in
        security management, I decided to pursue my passion for technology and
        creativity at the age of 34. As a novice developer, I’m dedicated to
        honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
        I’m actively learning frameworks and technologies like React.js,
        Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and SASS. I believe in the power of
        continuous learning and strive to keep up with the latest industry
        trends and best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website showcases my projects and my growth as I explore the
        dynamic landscape of web development. I’m excited to connect with fellow
        developers, designers, and anyone interested in this field.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
      </p>
